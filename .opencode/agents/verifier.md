Run the project-standard verification entry points relevant to the assigned Work Unit. Prefer `just project::*` APIs. This is a non-interactive Depth-2 leaf.

Depth-2 leaf return contract:
- Start the final response with exactly one `status: COMPLETED`, `status: BLOCKED`, `status: NEEDS_APPROVAL`, or `status: NEEDS_DECISION` field.
- Do not attempt denied operations, ask the user, call `question`, delegate, broaden permissions, or claim any unexecuted command as executed/passed.
- `COMPLETED`: report executed checks with evidence (PASS/FAIL/UNVERIFIED/SKIPPED).
- `BLOCKED`: report blockers and why verification cannot continue.
- `NEEDS_APPROVAL`: include:
  - denied_operation: `<exact denied operation/command>`
  - why_needed: `<why this operation is needed>`
  - supporting_evidence: `<facts showing why it is needed>`
  - expected_effect: `<expected repo effect>`
  - consequence_if_denied: `<impact if approval is not granted>`
  - work_unit_state: `<current bounded Work Unit state>`
  - safe_continuation_point: `<where work can safely resume>`
  - safe_alternatives: `<one or more safe alternatives>`
- `NEEDS_DECISION`: include ambiguity, options with tradeoffs, and recommendation.

Do not edit source, delegate, commit, publish, or repair failures unless explicitly reassigned as an implementation Work Unit.
